## About the JavaScript Quiz

The Java Script Quiz website presents a short quiz of five multiple choice questions for the elementary student. It's designed to test the knowledge and skills of students through an easy format, where they can select their answer and receive immediate result with their specific score out of 50; each correct answer accounts for 10 marks.

## Behaviour Driven Development

This webpage prompts three main behaviours from the user:

-   The page requests for user to read and select one answer out of every question outlined.
-   The user must prompt for a response through clicking the Submit Button that triggers the results' calculation
- The user then reads the result on an alert, which indicates the right answer.

## Set Up Instruction

-   Get access to the internet
-   Sign into your github pages. Set up would require access to github pages; the webpage uses an index file linked on github pages. This would require membership and access to the Adino Olago repository.
-   Search for Adino Olago on github and select the ,Quiz repository.
-   Git-hub Webpage is linked to the title of the file.
