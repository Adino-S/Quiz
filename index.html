      JavaScript is a programming language that:
      (a) is strict about variable type and declaration (b) is a web-specific version of Java
      (c) supports event-driven programming
      (d) is executed on the server
      Best practices for JavaScript include:
      (a) embedding JavaScript implicitly rather than explicitly (b) registering event handlers outside of HTML tags
      (c) declaring all variables
      (d) all of the above
      JavaScript's quirks include:
      (a) all text is of type String; there is no type for single characters
      (b) the Number type represents only integers
      (c) events are only generated by the user's browsing activities (d) accessing elements via Document Organization Management
